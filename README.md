# Portfolio

###Projects I've done for school:
- Bank - (Demonstrates Polymorphism in C++)
- SimulatorMk2 - (CPU Scheduling Simulation)

###Projects I've done in my spare time:
- Project Euler Solutions - ([https://projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net "Project Euler"))
	- Though any language may be used to solve Project Euler problems, I have decided to use C++ exclusively to prove that I can get around the limitations of the language to solve complicated problems (See Problem 20 as an example).
- Game1 - (Pokemon based fan game created from the program RPG Maker XP)

###Works In Progress
- RPG - (Text based RPG fighting system)
